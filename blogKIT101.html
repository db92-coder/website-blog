            There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn't quite comprehend what this meant. "Why would only half a
            worm be living in an apple?" she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken
            expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that.
            It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the
            years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare.
            The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it was a choice
            nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In the
            end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue.

            Debbie put her hand into the hole, sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach. She wiggled her fingers hoping
            to touch something, but all she felt was air. She shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more
            down the hole. Her fingers still touched nothing but air.
            He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn't believe him was
            quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed
            impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.
            I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a
            thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It's
            better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and
            marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and then it
            takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends. All
            things in moderation.

                    his
                    intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                    smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                    deduced, but nobody was
                    really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared
                    about

                    intelligence.</p>
