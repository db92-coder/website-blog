            He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so
            difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were
            willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
            She tried to explain that love wasn't like pie. There wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less
            to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another. That after a set amount was given out it would all
            disappear. She tried to explain this, but it fell on deaf ears.
            There was a time and a place for Stephanie to use her magic. The problem was that she had a difficult time determining
            this. She wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn't be any unforeseen consequences.
            Unfortunately, that's not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at
            the wrong time.

                    his
                    intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                    smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                    deduced, but nobody was
                    really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared

                    intelligence.</p>
