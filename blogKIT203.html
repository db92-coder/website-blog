            There wasn't a whole lot he could do at that moment. He played the situation again and again in his head looking at what
            he might have done differently to make the situation better. No matter how many times he relived the situation in his
            head, there was never really a good alternative course of action. There simply wasn't a whole lot he could have done in
            that particular moment.
            She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that
            she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had
            it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that
            was the most important.
            He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been perfection and he
            knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost.

            It was a concerning development that he couldn't get out of his mind. He'd had many friends throughout his early years
            and had fond memories of playing with them, but he couldn't understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as
            he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last.
            Her hand was balled into a fist with her keys protruding out from between her fingers. This was the weapon her father
            had shown her how to make when she walked alone to her car after work. She wished that she had something a little more
            potent than keys between her fingers. It would have been nice to have some mace or pepper spray. He had been meaning to
            buy some but had never gotten around to it. As the mother bear took another step forward with her cubs in tow, she knew
            her fist with keys wasn't going to be an adequate defense for this situation.
            Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to
            experience. As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself in a little more than
            she bargained for. It wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking
            to make her their next meal.

                    his
                    intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                    smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                    deduced, but nobody was
                    really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared
