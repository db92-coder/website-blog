            How to get the most from your study

            "Begin today!" That's all the note said. There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it
            been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she
            thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she
            crumpled it up and threw it away.
            The time had come for Nancy to say goodbye. She had been dreading this moment for a good six months, and it had finally
            arrived despite her best efforts to forestall it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't keep the inevitable from
            happening. So the time had come for a normal person to say goodbye and move on. It was at this moment that Nancy decided
            not to be a normal person. After all the time and effort she had expended, she couldn't bring herself to do it.
            There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn't immediately clear. But there was definitely something
            in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger.

        <p class="description206" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
        It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is
        something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to
        act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next
        Finding the truth wouldn't be easy, that's for sure. Then there was the question of whether or not Jane really wanted to
        know the truth. That's the thing that bothered her most. It wasn't the difficulty of actually finding out what happened
        that was the obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found.
        Devon couldn't figure out the color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that they were green, but the more he
        looked at them he almost wanted to say they were a golden yellow. Then there were the flashes of red and orange that
        seemed to be streaked throughout them. It was almost as if her eyes were made of opal with the sun constantly glinting
        off of them and bringing out more color. They were definitely the most unusual pair of eyes he'd ever seen.

                    his
                    intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                    smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                    deduced, but nobody was
                    really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared
                    about
                    his
                    intelligence.</p>
