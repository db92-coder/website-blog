        Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated
        with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn't really matter how they felt because she simply didn't care.
        Where do they get a random paragraph?" he wondered as he clicked the generate button. Do they just write a random
        paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random
        paragraphs and his world would never be the same.
        Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous.
        Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to publically sing that
        first song.

            <p class="company-description">He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his
                intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                deduced, but nobody was
                really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about
                his
                intelligence.</p>
