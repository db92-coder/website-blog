        Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated
        with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn't really matter how they felt because she simply didn't care.
        Where do they get a random paragraph?" he wondered as he clicked the generate button. Do they just write a random
        paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random
        paragraphs and his world would never be the same.
        Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous.
        Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to publically sing that
        first song.

        Brock would have never dared to do it on his own he thought to himself. That is why Kenneth and he had become such good
        friends. Kenneth forced Brock out of his comfort zone and made him try new things he'd never imagine doing otherwise. Up
        to this point, this had been a good thing. It had expanded Brock's experiences and given him a new appreciation for
        life. Now that both of them were in the back of a police car, all Brock could think was that he would have never dared
        do it except for the influence of Kenneth.
        Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now. He wasn't sure what exactly had made him choose
        this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and
        just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.
        He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the
        wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. Thereâ€™s Stonehenge. But
        he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn't make any sense and he wondered how he was ever
        going to be able to explain it.

            <p class="company-description">He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his
                intelligence. There was no doubt that he was
                smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
                deduced, but nobody was
                really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about
                his
                intelligence.</p>
